To add a photo of a German Shepherd, you can add the following code inside the `story-container` div:

```
<img src="content/images/german_shepherd.jpg" alt="German Shepherd" />
```

Make sure to replace `content/images/german_shepherd.jpg` with the actual path and file name of the image. You can also add styling to the image, such as `max-width` or `margin`. Here is the updated code:

```
    <div class="story-container">
        <h2>Touching Story About a Dog</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time in a small village, there lived a kindhearted dog named Max...</p>
        <img src="content/images/german_shepherd.jpg" alt="German Shepherd" style="max-width: 100%; margin-top: 30px;" />
    <!-- ...rest of story... -->
    </div>
```
